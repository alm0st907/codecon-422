# codecon-422
Defcon scale based task tracker project for CptS 422
**Download node+npm**

- `cd codecon`
- **The package.json file should be updated such that you only have to do `npm i` and not run the next step.**
- Run `npm i react react-dom react-scripts bootstrap reactstrap react-konva konva react-router-dom styled-components eslint` as this will install the dependencies.  
- Run `npm i npm-check-updates -g`
- It is important to check for updates when inside the codecon directory, so run `ncu -u` and then `npm install`
- To begin running the app, `npm start` which builds on localhost
